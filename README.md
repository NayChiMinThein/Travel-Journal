I've just completed my second solo project, using React and Tailwind CSS to create a responsive static website. While it's not dynamic and relies on manually generated data, my goal is to advance to more dynamic projects using React and Tailwind CSS in the future. I'm excited about the learning journey ahead and the potential to create more interactive websites.
